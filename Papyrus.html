<h2>Papyrus</h2>

<p><a href="https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Papyrus" title="Undertale Wiki" target="_blank"><strong>Papyrus (/pəˈpaɪrəs/ pə-PY-rəs)</strong></a> is the brother of <a href="Sans.html">Sans</a> and a major character in Undertale.
His main motive is to capture a human so he can become a member of the Royal Guard, and finally have friends and popularity.</p><br>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">Papyrus is a tall, perhaps anatomically inaccurate skeleton, with a skull more vertical and geometric than his brother.
Being skeletal, many of his expressions incorporate a toothy grin. His eyes resemble vertical slits; his skeletal pseudo-brows form most of his expressions.
He has eyeballs which show at times when he is experiencing strong emotions.</P>
