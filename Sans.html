  <h2>Sans</h2>
  <p><a href="https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Sans" title="Undertale Wiki" target="_blank"><strong>Sans (/s√¶nz/)</strong></a> is the brother of Papyrus and a major character in Undertale.

  <P style="margin-top:40px;">Sans appears as a short, paunchy skeleton with a wide toothy grin, glove-like hands and large eye sockets.
     He wears an unzipped blue hoodie, a white shirt, black shorts with white lining, and a pair of salmon-colored slippers.
     He has white pupils that disappear when he is serious or angered. When Sans uses telekinesis, his left eye flashes light blue and yellow, the colors for patience and justice, and his right pupil disappears.</p>
