  <p style="margin-top:40px;">Toriel is a Boss Monster whose head resembles a white-furred Nubian Goat, structured with droopy ears and short horns.
    She has a pair of visible fangs and long eyelashes, and her irises have a dark red tint.
    She has an anthropomorphic body, with paws at the end of her limbs. She wears a long purple robe that displays the Delta Rune on her chest.
    Toriel is seen with her reading glasses, one instance being in her house when reading a book on snail facts.
